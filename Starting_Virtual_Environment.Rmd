```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Open a terminal in the directory of the repository. If you have not set up a virtual environment in that directory already, run

\center

```{verbatim, fig.align='center'}
python3 -m venv venv
```
\raggedright

After that, you will need to activate the virtual environment.

\center

```{verbatim, fig.align='center'}
source venv/bin/activate
```
\raggedright

To run the flask for testing, you will need to tell Flask how to import the project.

\center

```{verbatim, fig.align='center'}
export FLASK_APP=wishlist.py
```
\raggedright

Once that is done, you can run it:

\center

```{verbatim, fig.align='center'}
flask run
```
\raggedright

You can then observe the webpage at http://localhost:5000/.
